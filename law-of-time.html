    <h1>The Law of Time</h1>
    
    <p>Some 1400 years after the birth of Muhammad, in AD 1974, 22 years after the opening of the tomb of Pacal Votan, Dr. Rashad Khalifa discovered the "nineteen code" a complex mathematical matrix based on the number 19 which intricately underlies theHoly Qur'an, holding it together in a way which no human could devise and which demonstrates the perfection of its unchangeable form (See: Scientific American, September, 1980, pp. 22-24). The consequence of this discovery of the nineteen code was proof to Khalifa that the Holy Qur'an is the indisputable revelation of the divine One, Allah, and hence is the authoritative criterion for humanity in the last stage of the historical cycle.</p>

    <p>If nineteen is the code number used by the absolute to demonstrate the total authority of its word through the miraculous Qur'an, and the Holy Qur'an is a pure expression of the absolute, then nineteen should also appear in the highest teachings of the people of the dawn of the day time of the New World. The Law of Time vindicates this connection. 0-19 is the complete vigesimal number code that underlies the mathematics of fourth-dimensional time, nineteen being the supreme number with the highest power.</p>

    <p>The mathematics of the 0-19 code was implemented by the Maya of the day time New World in all of their calendrics at the same time that Muhammad in the Old World was reciting and compiling the Qur'an. And just as the crescent moon and star of Islam represent the night people of the Old World, the sun, "Kinich Ahau," is the key symbol of the Mayan calendar of the day people of the New World. While the night people of the Old World operated with lunar calendars, the day people of the New World, developed the only genuinely solar calendars.</p>

    <p>Although Babylonian Christendom vanquished the people of the dawn of the New World, obliterating their knowledge of the Law of Time, while holding Islam at bay in the Old World, the workings of the absolute cannot be defied, restrained, or hidden for long. Crescent moon, star and sun are all brought together in the discovery of the divine Law of Time. The nineteen code of the Holy Qur'an is completed by the 0-19 code of the Law of Time. The absolute is lord of both East and West. The Old World and the New World are joined and transcended. All true revelations affirm each other.</p>

    <p>Because of the discovery of the Law of Time, the people of the book and the people of the dawn are reunited as the people of the day of truth. The promise of the people of the dawn was not really destroyed, but through the Law of Time is revealed as the perfect measure and criterion for human evolutionary progress. The solar-galactic cycle is the absolute measure of spiritual perfection for humanity consciously engaged in the knowledge and practice of fourth-dimensional time.</p>
